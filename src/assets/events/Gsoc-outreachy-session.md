**The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreachy programs** give new contributors to open source the opportunity to gain real world experience by working on a 12+ week coding project with one of about 200 open source organizations under the guidance of dedicated mentors. They also pay a competitive stipend during the internship period. If you are interested in learning about these programs join us this Saturday at 6pm.
