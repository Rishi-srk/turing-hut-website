Team Turing Hut successfully hosted CodeNox 2.0: Octcoder Reloaded, the second edition of Octcoder, a coding contest designed to provide a competitive experience similar to ICPC and the Meta Hacker Cup. The event featured three intense rounds—Code Flash, Attack on Code, and Midnight CodeFest—with a total of 160+ teams registering. After intense competition, 99 teams advanced to Round 2, and only 25 teams made it to the final round.

Rounds 1 and 2 were hosted on HackerRank, while the final round took place on Codeforces and was hosted on a custom Turing Hut event page, developed by our Dev team. The Midnight CodeFest saw a unique challenge where a new problem was released every hour, pushing participants' critical thinking to the limit. A huge shoutout to the Dev team for their innovative setup and to the problem setters for crafting such complex puzzles. The entire contest was anime-themed, adding an extra layer of excitement.

For those who missed CodeNox or want to improve their skills, here are the links to the problems from each round, along with the editorials. We encourage you to try out the rounds, learn from the editorials, and keep pushing your limits!

# Interesting Reads

- **Blink and Comprehend: Unveiling the Brain’s Rapid Language Processing** <br/>New research from NYU reveals that our brains can process the structure of a sentence in just 150 milliseconds, about the speed of a blink. This rapid comprehension is akin to how we quickly perceive visual scenes. Using advanced brain scanning techniques, scientists found that the left temporal cortex detects sentence structure almost instantly, even when errors or illogical phrases are present. These findings highlight the brain's ability to swiftly interpret language, shedding light on how we understand fast digital messages.

- **AI-Powered Gene Control: A New Era of Precision Medicine** <br/> Researchers from The Jackson Laboratory, MIT, Harvard, and Yale have used AI to design new DNA switches (cis-regulatory elements or CREs) that precisely control gene expression in specific cell types. Their AI-driven platform, CODA, enables the creation of synthetic CREs that activate genes in targeted tissues, such as the liver or brain, without affecting others. This breakthrough allows for unprecedented precision in gene therapy, with potential applications in biomanufacturing and medicine. Their work, tested in zebrafish and mice, could revolutionize how gene therapies are tailored for specific cell types in the body.
