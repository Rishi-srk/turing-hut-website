We can't believe it's November already. It's the time of the year to recall the goals you set at the beginning of the year and try to get done as much as possible in these two months before the year ends.

We have received very few responses to our forms so far, so we want to collect your feedback to decide whether to continue the newsletter or not. We want this newsletter to create a sense of community among the students where everyone feels involved irrespective of their year or branch, hence the community's feedback is important to us.
Please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBtnICdRsHkCzZAEzkAo1fbPb9-xRlL22ZNkhI0ws2n3SdVg/viewform) and share your feedback
