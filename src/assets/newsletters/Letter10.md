Do you use ChatGPT? Google Bard is here! It's the latest chatbot developed by Google and it's causing a stir in the tech world. It's still in the testing stage. Everyone's wondering if it can take on ChatGPT. One thing that makes Google Bard stand out is that it can use real-time data, which is way cooler than ChatGPT that only uses data up until 2021. Bard uses this fancy LaMDA technology on top of Google's Transformer neural network architecture. This architecture is also used as the foundation for other AI generative tools, including ChatGPT's GPT-3 language model.
