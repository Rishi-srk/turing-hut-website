HackWithInfy is a coding competition for engineering students organized every year by Infosys. It involves a coding assessment followed by a hackathon for the shortlisted participants. A. Rukmananda Reddy, a final-year CSE student was one of the students to qualify for the hackathon. For the hackathon, his team worked on Drone based Bio-Diversity Management using machine learning. The team secured fourth position in the hackathon. He says it was an invaluable experience from traveling to a new city to learning with his team and mentors.

# Reading picks

- **Keep it simple! How to understand the Gradient Descent algorithm** <br/>
  Many machine learning techniques from linear regression to neural networks use optimization algorithms to minimize a loss function. Gradient descent is the most commonly used optimization method, hence having a basic intuition of it can help in understanding many ML and DL techniques.
