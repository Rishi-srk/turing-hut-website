<b>Ankan</b> and <b>Sushmanth</b>, two passionate coders with a knack for problem-solving, met at the Turing Cup contest, which is organized annually by VNRVJIET's programming club, Turing Hut. Despite being from different colleges, Ankan and Sushmanth quickly found common ground in their shared interest in Competitve Coding. Ankan and Sushmanth's partnership in coding competitions was a winning combination. They consistently participated in other numerous highly competitive coding competitions and emerged victorious. The two coders didn't limit themselves to just winning coding contests, they also collaborated on challenging web development projects, constantly pushing each other to improve.

- **Can we finally detect AI-written content?** <br/>
  In the past months, weâ€™ve seen the launch of many tools that try to detect AI-written text. However, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, launched its own text classifier that aims to distinguish between AI-written and human-written text. This is a free tool that has some limitations but it can still help you detect whether something was written by AI.

- **Why GraphQL is the future of APIs?** <br/>
  Since the beginning of the web, developing APIs has been a difficult task for developers. The way we develop our APIs must evolve with time so that we can always build good, intuitive and well-designed APIs. In the last few years, GraphQL has been growing in popularity among developers. A lot of companies have started adopting this technology to build their APIs. GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook in 2012 and released publicly in 2015. It has been gaining a lot of traction. It has been adopted by a lot of big companies such as Spotify, Facebook, GitHub, NYTimes, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.
